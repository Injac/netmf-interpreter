However, the v4.3 installers are available from the [.NET Micro Framework CodePlex site](http://netmf.codeplex.com/releases/view/611040) \r\n\r\n### Developer Builds\r\nThis is where we will post links to the latest developer builds. There aren't any yet as we haven't set up our automated build system to connect to GitHub yet. Once we do we'll have regular builds here for partner and early adopter testing and validation.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
